abstract|    <p>     Octopamine (OA) appears to function as the invertebrate counterpart of norepinephrine (NE) in the modulation of a number of key behaviors. In      <italic>C. elegans,</italic>      OA signaling is complex, mediated by at least three distinct   -adrenergic-like receptors and appears to activate more global peptidergic signaling cascades that have the potential to dramatically amplify the octopaminergic signal. These OA-dependent peptidergic signaling cascades involve an array of neuropeptides that activate receptors throughout the nervous system and have the potential to both directly and indirectly modulate locomotory decision-making. In this commentary we highlight the use of      <italic>C. elegans</italic>      as a model to expand our understanding of noradrenergic signaling in mammals, specifically as it relates to the role of NE in anti-nociception.    </p>
